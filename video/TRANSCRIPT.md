## Introduction (0-40s)

Hi everyone, this is team YYDSCI. Our team-members are Chengyuan Zhou, Yuqi Xiao and Qiyun Zhang. In this project, we explored the relationship between unemployment rate and suicide rate. 
Our project will be able to provide insights on suicide rate from another dimension because previous works only focus on either analysis or visulaztion but not the both. We visualized the relationships in multiple charts using the d3 library in the react framework with the bootstrap grid system. We’ve also analyzed many papers to explore other potential factors that may cause suicide in the U.S. 
We demonstrate our work in the form of a dashboard because this is a straight-forward and efficient way of displaying information. We will walk you through the webpage now:

## Body (41s-3m28s)

Map: First, geographical distribution of these two rate among each states, choropleth maps offer a clear presentation between these two rates.

Sunburst: As we can see, multiple states which have high unemployment rate stay damp color for the suicide rate map. Which means that not all states which high unemployment rate has high sucide rate

Bar1: After an overview of data, we can use an interactive bar chart to check the comparison between states for each rate. The default setting shows the 50 states' descending comparison.

Bar2: By filteing the 10 states with highest/lowest rate, we can easily see that only very few states overlap to each other, which means the states with high suicide rate may not have a high unemployment rate.

MapBox: The marker in the boxmap shows the states with top 5 suicide rate and unemployment rate, this is very clear that the ornage and blue makers are separated. Only one of them overlaps, which means the states with high suicide rate does not have corresponding unemployment rate.

ScatterPlot: From the above charts we could get a rough idea that suicide rate may not strong corelate with the unemployment rate. Here, we use a scatter plot to check the correlation between them. The year button gives us the ability to check data for more than one year. The data from 2014 to 2016 all shows a weak correlation between these two rates.

## Conclusion (3m29s - 4m33s)

From above visualization, we found out that Suicide rate is not mainly affected by the Unemployment rate.
However, we are curious about which factors influence suicide besides unemployment. But we do not find the data that evaluate different factors’ effects on suicide quantatively.

Thus, we do further research by reading others’ papers and summarize potential factors and generate our own data of other factors effects on suicide to prove this idea by this zoomable circle

From the data we gathered, there are many other factors contributing to a high suicide rate in U.S. Other factors are more influential than unemployment.

Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that Suicide is not mainly affected by Unemployment among U.S
