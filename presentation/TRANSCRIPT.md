## Slide 1
Introduction: Hello everyone, we are team YYDSCI, In our project, we are trying to explore whether unemployment mainly cause suicide in U.S or not. We want to visualize these two rates and see if  there is a correlation between them. It’s useful because past works all focused on analyzing or visualizing individually. There is no visualization exploring their relationship. So our project can provide insights from another perspective.
## Slide 2
Contributions of Team Members: Our tasks include building multiple visualizations components such as heat map mapbox, sunburst plot and interactive charts.  We also need to do react-d3 integration and web page layout. We make sure every team member takes part in the whole process to collaborate and learn from each other
## Slide 3
Data and Topic: Our data consists of unemployment rate and suicide rate for all 50 states in U.S. from year 2014 to 2016. We also gathered data of different factors causing suicide from our research. We used different charts to do the comparison and exploration. 
## Slide 4
Research: Most research we can find online about unemployment and suicide rates are focused on the analysis, casues and statistical methods. However, they  lack clear and well-designed visualizations. Thus we've decided to make contributions on this.
## Slide 5
Stories: Here is our story. Based on those research, we know that unemployment may or may not be one factor of suicide. To explore this question, we visualize this factor in different formats, such as heatmap, bar chart, scatter plot, ect. to best understand the idea. But we do not see very strong relations between them.
## Slide 6
Proof of Original Work:In this case, we are curious about which factors influence suicide besides unemployment, but we do not find the data that evaluate different factors’ effects on suicide quantatively. Thus, we do further research by reading others’ papers and summarize potential factors and generate our own data of other factors effects on suicide to prove this idea by visualization, for example, applying zoomable circles.)
## Slide 7
Design: We've chosen a visualization dashboard as it is a straight-forward and efficient way of displaying data. So we used a compact layout to fit all of our charts into one page. Users will be able to scroll up and down for different visualizations and there is no need to switch between different tabs. We turned the background to dark because this will highlight the charts so people will not be distracted by other non-essential elements.
## Slide 8
Elements: We've created heat maps displaying the distribution of unemployment rates and suicide rate across all states in U.S. We've also implemented two interactive, responsive and animation charts. All charts are integrated with react framework using node.js with bootstrap grid system. 
## Slide 9
Would have done differently: If we have more time granted on this project, we would have dived deeper into the specific states with high suicide rate to explore more potential factors of suicide such as demographic, environmental and economical factors. 
## Slide 10
Here are techniques we applied: We applied Pandas to preprocess data, and Python to convert self-generated data to json format. For visualization, we learnt new frameworks and dealt with many unexpected issues such as incompatible environments. We applied d3 with bootstrap and react framework to achieve the purpose of our project.
