(Note: We deployed the react-app to the github webpage, however, the world map from the MapBox might not work as expected because of compatibility issue, while other charts works prefectly, we have already communited this with Professor. 
I think this is okay because with being said deployment is extra. 
The mapbox works well on our local server. We will show the working mapbox in the youtube video as the assignment requires)



## Project Summary
Suicide became a serious issues in recent years. With the break-out ofCovid-19, many people lost their job and became unemployment. We want toexplore if there is any relationship between this two issues, specifically, whethersuicide is mainly caused by unemployment in U.S or not. 
Many previous works focused on analyzing the correlations and the potentialcauses but lack the proper visualizations to display the result. Some papers dida great job displaying the information but lack the careful analysis that followthe logic of their visualization part. We will combine the advantages of thesework by linking the analysis and visualizations to provide insights from a newperspective.We also aim to explore the result of the research question in an user-friendlyway, so that people even with no data science background can understand it. In this case, we developed a web-based app to provide with data vividly and various graphs following the research logic.
